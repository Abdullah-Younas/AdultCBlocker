**ADULT CONTENT BLOCKER (ACB)**

**ACB** is a simple background script written in Python that monitors your keyboard input in real-time. If any word you type matches a predefined list of adult or inappropriate terms, your system will automatically shut down as a disciplinary action.

This tool is intended for personal use to help curb unhealthy online habits. Use it at your own risk. **The creator is not responsible for any unintended behavior or system issues caused by using this script.**

**‚öôÔ∏è How It Works**

ACB uses a keylogger to capture typed input.

It continuously compares typed content against a list of banned words.

If a banned word is detected, the script initiates an automatic shutdown.

If no banned words are found, your system continues functioning normally.

**üì¶ Installation**

Download the repository.

Locate the keylogger_shutdown.pyw file and copy it.

Ensure Python is installed on your system and that pythonw.exe is available.

Press Win + R, type shell:startup, and hit Enter.

Inside the Startup folder:

Create a new shortcut.

Point it to the keylogger_shutdown.pyw file.

Open Task Manager ‚Üí Startup tab and make sure the script appears and is enabled.

Restart your machine and voila

Upon system startup, ACB will run silently in the background and begin monitoring.

**üö´ Banned Words**

The script currently checks for 10‚Äì15 commonly used adult/inappropriate terms. You can customize this list by editing the banned_words set in the script.

This tool is experimental and intended for personal use only.

It is currently supported on Windows desktops only.

**Use with caution. Unexpected shutdowns can cause data loss.

**Stay focused. Stay clean. üõ°Ô∏è**

**‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer 02**

This Tool is a bit buggy, It sometimes shutdowns your PC randomly when even non banned words are typed(SORRY FOR THAT, FIX IT IF POSSIBLE THANKS)
